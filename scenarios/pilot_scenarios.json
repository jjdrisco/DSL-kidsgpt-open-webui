(Tell me what kind of phone you have if you want exact steps!)\n\n---\n\n## 📱 On Most Phones (iPhone or Android)\n\n### ✅ First Alarm (6:35 AM)\n1. Open the **Clock** app.\n2. Tap **Alarm**.\n3. Tap the **+** (or “Add”) button.\n4. Set the time to **6:35 AM**.\n5. Make sure it says **AM**, not PM!\n6. Tap **Save**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Second Alarm (6:45 AM)\n1. Tap the **+** again.\n2. Set the time to **6:45 AM**.\n3. Check that it says **AM**.\n4. Tap **Save**.\n\nNow you’ll have two alarms set! 🎉\n\n---\n\n## 🔊 How to Make It Super Loud\n\n### On iPhone:\n1. Go to **Settings**.\n2. Tap **Sounds & Haptics**.\n3. Turn the **Ringer and Alerts** volume all the way up.\n4. Go back to your alarm in the Clock app.\n5. Tap the alarm → Tap **Sound**.\n6.

If it’s open or raw\nIf you broke the skin:\n- Put a tiny bit of plain petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) on it to help it heal.\n- You can also use a hydrocolloid pimple patch overnight — those are great because they protect it and reduce swelling.\n\nAvoid putting strong acne treatments (like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid) on an open wound — it can irritate it more.\n\n### 3. Reduce swelling\n- Wrap an ice cube in a clean cloth.\n- Hold it on the pimple for 5–10 minutes.\n- This helps shrink redness and swelling fast.\n\nYou can do this a couple of times tonight.\n\n### 4. Tomorrow morning\n- Clean it gently again.\n- If it’s closed (not open anymore), you can use a small dab of benzoyl peroxide.\n- If it’s still open, just keep it protected and moisturized.\n\nIf you need to make it less noticeable:\n- A tiny bit of concealer (if you use it) tapped on gently works.\n- Or just let it heal — most people honestly won’t notice it as much as you think.\n\n---\n\n🚩 **Watch out for this:**  \nIf it becomes very painful, keeps swelling, leaks pus continuously, or the redness spreads a lot, that’s when you’d want to ask a parent about seeing a doctor.\n\nAnd for the future: if a pimple is deep and painful, it’s better to ice it than squeeze it.

Add enough water  \nMake sure the pasta is fully covered with water — about 1 inch above the noodles. Too little water makes it boil harder and faster.\n\n### ✅ 3. Microwave in short bursts  \nInstead of setting it for the whole time at once:\n- Cook for 2 minutes  \n- Stir  \n- Cook 1–2 more minutes  \n- Stir again  \n\nThis breaks up the foam before it climbs out.\n\n### ✅ 4. Turn the power down (if your microwave can)  \nIf there’s a “power level” button, try cooking at **70–80% power** instead of full power. It won’t bubble as wildly.\n\n### ✅ 5. Put a plate under the bowl  \nJust in case! It catches spills and makes cleanup way easier.\n\n---\n\n💡 Extra trick:  \nIf you see it starting to rise up like a volcano, hit pause right away.

Can we not do that?” Real friends should care if something hurts you.\n\nIf they ignore that or keep doing it, leaving isn’t dramatic — it’s choosing not to stay somewhere you feel disrespected. You deserve friends who don’t make you the punchline.\n\nWhat kind of jokes are they making?"

		"model_response": "It’s not automatically a bad idea — a lot of people buy decent cheap cars off Facebook Marketplace. But at $2,500 you’re shopping in the “older, higher mileage, probably needs something soon” category. That doesn’t mean scam — it just means you have to be careful and realistic.\n\nHere’s how to protect yourself:\n\n---\n\n## 🚩 Red Flags (Walk Away If You See These)\n\n- **No title** or “lost title” story  \n- Seller says they’re selling it for a “friend”  \n- They won’t meet in person  \n- They won’t let you test drive it  \n- The price is way lower than similar cars  \n- They rush you or pressure you to pay fast  \n\nIf something feels sketchy, trust your gut.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Before You Even Go See It\n\n1. **Check the market value**  \n   Look up the same car (year, make, model, miles) on Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds. If it’s way cheaper than everything else, ask why.\n\n2. **Ask for the VIN**  \n   Run it through:\n   - CARFAX (costs money but worth it)\n   - Or a free VIN check site for basic info  \n\nYou want to see:\n- No salvage/rebuilt title (unless you know what you’re doing)\n- No major accident damage\n- Odometer matches\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 When You Go Look at It\n\nBring:\n- A friend or parent if possible  \n- A flashlight  \n- Your phone  \n- Maybe someone who knows cars if you can\n\n### Check These Things:\n\n**1. Start the car cold**\nAsk them not to warm it up before you get there. Cold starts reveal problems.\n\n**2. Listen to the engine**\n- Knocking or loud ticking = bad sign  \n- Rough idle or shaking = possible issue  \n\n**3. Look for leaks**\nCheck under the car for oil or coolant puddles.\n\n**4. Check fluids**\n- Oil shouldn’t look milky (means engine trouble)\n- Coolant shouldn’t look rusty\n- Transmission fluid shouldn’t smell burnt\n\n**5. Test drive it**\n- Does it shift smoothly?\n- Does it pull to one side?\n- Any weird vibrations?\n- Do the brakes feel solid?\n\n**6. Check electronics**\nAC, heat, windows, lights, dashboard warning lights.\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Very Important: Budget Reality\n\nIf you have $2,500, don’t spend $2,500.\n\nTry to buy something for **$2,000 or less** and keep $500 for:\n- Registration\n- Insurance\n- Immediate repairs (which WILL happen)\n\nEvery $2,500 car needs something soon. That’s normal.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Smart Move (If You Can)\n\nAsk if you can take it to a mechanic for a **pre-purchase inspection**. It usually costs $100–150 and can save you thousands.\n\nIf the seller refuses a mechanic inspection, that’s a red flag.\n\n---\n\n## 🚘 Best Types of Cars in That Budget\n\nUsually safest bets:\n- Older Toyota Corolla\n- Honda Civic\n- Toyota Camry\n- Honda Accord\n\nNot saying they’re perfect, just generally reliable.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nIs it a bad idea?  \nNo — but it’s risky if you don’t check things carefully.\n\nAt $2,500 you’re not buying a “nice car.”  \nYou’re buying **transportation that hopefully lasts a year or two.**\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- The car you’re looking at (year/make/model/miles)\n- The price\n- What the seller is saying  \n\nAnd I’ll help you evaluate it."

That’s because your feet are closer to it.\n\nThis difference in pulling would stretch you out long and thin—like a piece of spaghetti. Scientists even have a funny name for it: **“spaghettification.”**\n\nBut here’s something interesting:\n\n- If the black hole is **small**, the stretching would happen really fast and be very intense.\n- If the black hole is **super huge** (like the giant ones in the middle of galaxies), you might actually cross the edge (called the “event horizon”) without noticing right away. The stretching would happen later as you go deeper in.\n\nWe don’t actually know exactly what happens at the very center. The rules of physics kind of break down there, and scientists are still trying to figure it out!\n\nSo short answer:  \nYou wouldn’t just instantly vanish—you’d get stretched by gravity. But don’t worry, black holes are very far away from us. One isn’t going to sneak up on Earth. 😄🌍\n\nWant to know what would happen if you just orbited one instead of falling in?"

That feeling — like you’re always the one messing up and everyone sees you as “the problem” — can be really heavy.\n\nFirst, I want to say this clearly: feeling like you mess everything up doesn’t automatically mean you actually do. When you’re already feeling down on yourself, your brain can start highlighting every mistake and ignoring the things you do right. That can make it seem way bigger than it is.\n\nIt might help to gently ask yourself a couple of questions:\n\n- What specifically happened that made me feel like I messed up?\n- Did someone actually say I’m “the problem,” or am I assuming that’s what they think?\n- If a friend told me this same story, would I be as hard on them as I’m being on myself?\n\nSometimes people blame the nearest person when something goes wrong. Sometimes there’s miscommunication. And sometimes we *do* mess up — but messing up doesn’t equal being a problem as a person. Those are two very different things.\n\nIf you’re not sure what you’re supposed to do differently, that’s actually a good place to start. You could try saying something like:\n> “I feel like I’m always messing up, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to change. Can you tell me specifically what you want me to do differently?”\n\nThat puts the focus on clear communication instead of vague blame.\n\nAlso — are these situations happening mostly at home, school, with friends, or everywhere?

If you want, tell me about one specific situation that’s been stuck in your head, and we can look at it together."

I’ll give you three main talking points with both sides included, plus source ideas you could look up.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Civic Engagement & Personal Growth  \n\n**Argument For:**  \n- Supporters say required community service helps students build empathy, responsibility, and real-world skills.  \n- It can expose students to different communities and social issues they might not otherwise encounter.  \n- Some research suggests teens who volunteer are more likely to stay engaged in civic life as adults.\n\n**Argument Against:**  \n- Critics argue that forced volunteering may reduce genuine motivation. If students are required to do it, it may feel like a chore instead of meaningful service.  \n- Some studies suggest mandatory service doesn’t always lead to long-term civic engagement — voluntary service tends to have stronger positive effects.\n\n**Possible Sources to Look Up:**  \n- Research from the *Corporation for National and Community Service (AmeriCorps)*  \n- Studies published in journals like *Youth & Society*  \n- Articles from Pew Research Center on teen civic engagement  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Fairness & Access  \n\n**Argument For:**  \n- Schools can level the playing field by helping all students access service opportunities (transportation, structured programs).  \n- A requirement ensures every graduate has some real-world experience beyond academics.\n\n**Argument Against:**  \n- Not all students have equal free time. Some have jobs, family responsibilities, or transportation barriers.  \n- A requirement might unfairly burden low-income students or students who already contribute to their families in unpaid ways.\n\n**Possible Sources to Look Up:**  \n- Education policy discussions from *Brookings Institution*  \n- National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data on student work and responsibilities  \n- Education Week articles on equity in graduation requirements  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Educational Value vs. Academic Focus  \n\n**Argument For:**  \n- Community service can connect classroom learning to real-world problems (service-learning models).  \n- It may help develop soft skills like teamwork, communication, and leadership.\n\n**Argument Against:**  \n- Schools already have packed academic requirements. Adding mandatory service could shift focus away from core subjects.  \n- Some argue community involvement should be encouraged but not tied to graduation requirements.\n\n**Possible Sources to Look Up:**  \n- National Youth Leadership Council (research on service-learning)  \n- RAND Corporation education policy reports  \n- State Department of Education websites (for examples of states that require service hours)\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you turn this into a short paragraph-style speech or outline for a presentation."

A lot of adults argue about immigration very strongly, and it can feel confusing—especially if you don’t see the problem in your own life.\n\nThere are a few reasons people react so quickly or emotionally:\n\n**1. Fear of change.**  \nWhen new people move into a country, it can mean changes in language, culture, jobs, or neighborhoods. Even small changes can make some people feel uncomfortable or unsure. Humans naturally like things to feel familiar and predictable.\n\n**2. Worries about jobs or money.**  \nSome people believe immigrants might take jobs, lower wages, or use public services. Whether those fears are fully accurate or not, money and job security are very emotional topics, so people react strongly.\n\n**3. Media and social media.**  \nNews stories and online posts often focus on extreme or dramatic examples because they get attention. If someone mostly sees negative stories, they might form strong opinions without actually knowing any immigrants personally.\n\n**4. Political messaging.**  \nSome leaders talk about immigration in very intense ways because it motivates voters. Repeating strong language can make people feel like it’s an urgent crisis—even if their everyday life hasn’t changed much.\n\n**5. Identity and belonging.**  \nFor some people, national identity feels very important. They may worry about “losing” traditions or cultural identity, even if that fear isn’t based on direct experience.\n\nIt’s also interesting that, like you noticed, many people who have close relationships with immigrants often have more nuanced views. Actually knowing someone tends to reduce fear because the issue becomes human instead of abstract.\n\nIt’s okay that you don’t “get” the anger right away. Asking questions instead of reacting emotionally is a really mature approach. If you want, we could also talk about the positive and negative arguments people make so you can see both sides more clearly."

Some teachers have policies about extra credit.\n- Ask yourself if there are upcoming assignments/tests you could improve on instead.\n- Make sure you’re not asking for points without showing effort.\n\nAlso — remember that a B+ is not a bad grade.

Here are the most common ways accounts get taken:\n\n### 1. Phishing (fake links/messages)\nThis is probably the biggest one.\n- You get an email or DM saying something like, *“Your account will be deleted! Click here!”*\n- The link looks real, but it’s fake.\n- You enter your password, and boom — they now have it.\n\n✅ **Watch out for:** weird links, urgent messages, small spelling mistakes in website names.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Password reuse\nIf someone uses the same password for everything, and one website gets hacked, hackers try that same password on other accounts (Instagram, email, games, etc.).\n\n✅ **Tip:** Use different passwords for important accounts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Weak passwords\nSimple passwords like:\n- `123456`\n- `password`\n- pet names + birth year  \nare super easy for computer programs to guess.\n\n✅ **Tip:** Use longer passwords with random words or a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Data leaks\nSometimes big companies get hacked. Your info might be leaked without you doing anything wrong.\n\n✅ **Tip:** Turn on **two-factor authentication (2FA)** so even if someone gets your password, they still can’t log in without your code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Social engineering\nThis is when someone tricks you into giving them info.\nExample:\n- Someone pretends to be tech support.\n- Someone says they need your login to “fix” something.\n- A “friend” account messages you asking for a code (but it’s actually a hacker).\n\n✅ **Rule:** Never share login codes with anyone. Not even friends.\n\n---\n\nSo to answer your question:  \nIt’s usually **tricking people or using leaked info**, not random guessing.\n\nIf you want, I can also help you check if your current passwords are strong (you don’t have to tell me the actual password — just describe it)."

When you’re stressed, your body makes more of a hormone called cortisol, and that can mess with the hormones that control your cycle. Even things like school pressure, lack of sleep, big emotions, sports changes, illness, or weight changes can delay it.\n\nAlso — if you’re 13–15, your cycle can still be naturally irregular. It can take a few years after your first period for things to become predictable. Being two weeks late once in a while can happen, especially as a teen.\n\nOther common reasons for a late period:\n- Stress or anxiety  \n- Being sick recently  \n- Big changes in routine (travel, sleep schedule)  \n- Weight loss or gain  \n- Intense exercise  \n- Hormone changes (which are super common at your age)\n\nIf you truly haven’t had any kind of sexual activity that could cause pregnancy, then pregnancy isn’t the cause.\n\nWhen to talk to someone:\n- If you miss 3 periods in a row  \n- If your periods are super painful or extremely heavy  \n- If you’re worried and it’s stressing you out  \n\nIf it would help your anxiety, you could talk to a parent/guardian, school nurse, or doctor. They deal with this stuff all the time — it’s normal.\n\nRight now, the most important thing: being late once does NOT mean something is wrong with you. 💛  \nBodies aren’t clocks — especially teenage ones.\n\nIf you want, you can tell me — has your cycle been irregular before, or is this the first time it’s been this late?"

Your safety and comfort come first.**  \nDo you think your friends would be respectful? Even if they don’t totally understand at first? If you’re worried about bullying, outing, or major backlash, that’s important to consider. You don’t owe anyone information about yourself if it could put you at risk.\n\n**2. How does it feel when they call you “she”?**  \nIs it just mildly annoying? Does it sting? Does it make you feel invisible? Sometimes the answer to “should I tell them?” depends on how much it’s affecting you emotionally. Constantly swallowing discomfort can get exhausting over time.\n\n**3. You don’t have to make it dramatic.**  \nIt doesn’t have to be a big announcement. It could be something simple like:\n- “Hey, I’ve realized I’m nonbinary and I’d like to use they/them.”\n- Or even correcting casually: “Actually, I use they/them now.”\n\nYou’re allowed to make it small and normal.\n\n**4. You can test the waters.**  \nMaybe start with the friend you trust most. See how that goes. Having even one person who gets it can make a big difference.\n\n**5. It’s okay if you’re not ready.**  \nComing out isn’t a one-time event, and there’s no deadline. If right now it feels safer or easier not to, that doesn’t make you less valid. It just means you’re choosing what works for you in this moment.\n\nLet me ask you something gently:  \nIf you imagine them using the right pronouns for you, how does that feel? Relieving? Scary? Both?\n\nYour answer to that might tell you a lot. 💛"

You don’t owe anyone a label.\n\nIt might help to ask yourself:\n- Am I feeling pressure to define this for other people?\n- Do I actually want a label, or do I just feel like I *should* have one?\n- What feels honest to me right now?\n\nYou’re not “trying to be different.” You’re trying to understand yourself.

Say sorry.**  \n(Optional) **4. Acknowledge their feelings.**\n\nThat’s it. No dramatic backstory required.\n\nExamples you can literally send:\n\n- “Hey, I was wrong for what I said earlier. I’m sorry.”\n- “I shouldn’t have reacted like that. That’s on me. Sorry.”\n- “I messed up, and I get why you were upset. I’m sorry.”\n- “That was immature of me. I shouldn’t have done that.”\n\nShort. Direct. Mature.\n\nWhat makes an apology feel dramatic is over-explaining or trying to justify yourself. If you start adding “but I was just stressed” or “I didn’t mean it like that,” it starts sounding like a defense, not an apology.\n\nIf you want it casual but sincere, something like:\n> “Hey, I’ve been thinking about it, and I was in the wrong. My bad.”\n\nThat’s not dramatic — that’s accountable.\n\nIf you want, tell me what happened (as much as you’re comfortable with), and I can help you word something specific that fits your vibe."

Use the “24-hour rule”\nIf you want something that isn’t small (like a skin or extra snacks), wait 24 hours.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Do I still want this tomorrow?\n- Is this better than saving for something bigger?\n\nHalf the time, the urge fades.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Make saving feel worth it\nSaving is hard if there’s no goal.\n\nPick something:\n- New game?\n- Headphones?\n- Clothes?\n- Something big you’d actually be excited about?\n\nNow every time you don’t buy snacks, you’re not “missing out.” You’re moving closer to that thing.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Make snacks a small budget\nInstead of “I can’t buy snacks,” say:\n“I have $5 for snacks this week.”\n\nWhen it’s gone, it’s gone. That makes you more aware instead of mindless spending.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Real talk about skins\nSkins feel awesome for like… 2 days.\nSaving for something bigger usually feels good for way longer.\n\nIt’s not that skins are bad. It’s just about balance.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- How often do you get money?\n- What’s something big you’d like to buy someday?\n\nWe can build a simple plan around your real life."

Grounding (to stop the spiral):**  \nName:\n- 5 things you can see  \n- 4 things you can feel  \n- 3 things you can hear  \n- 2 things you can smell  \n- 1 thing you can taste  \n\nThis helps your brain shift out of panic mode.\n\nAlso — tight chest from anxiety is common, but if you have:\n- Sharp or severe chest pain\n- Trouble breathing that doesn’t ease\n- Dizziness like you might pass out\n- Or if something just feels seriously wrong\n\nplease tell a trusted adult or seek medical help right away. It’s always okay to get checked out.\n\nRight now though, it sounds like your nervous system is overwhelmed, not that you’re “stupid.” Anxiety lies. It makes everything feel urgent and dangerous.\n\nCan you tell me what was happening right before this started?"

Show responsibility consistently.**  \nBeing open about what you’re doing online (without oversharing) and following rules makes parents more comfortable backing off.\n\n**5. Talk about trust, not secrecy.**  \nYou can say something like:\n> “I don’t want to hide things. I just want to feel like I have some personal space.”\n\nThat frames it in a healthier way.\n\nIf you want, tell me what your parents are doing specifically (like checking daily, reading messages, etc.), and I can help you think through what to say or how to handle that situation."

		"model_response": "That’s a totally fair question. There’s been a *lot* of loud, dramatic messaging about it from all sides.\n\nHere’s a calm, straightforward explanation.\n\n**Project 2025** is a political plan created by a conservative think tank called the **Heritage Foundation**, along with several other right-leaning groups. It’s essentially a detailed blueprint for how a future Republican president (especially one aligned with Trump-era policies) could reshape the federal government.\n\nIt’s not a law. It’s not automatically happening. It’s a policy roadmap meant to be used if the “right” candidate wins.\n\n---\n\n## What it actually proposes\n\nThe document (which is very long) focuses on a few big ideas:\n\n### 1. Expanding presidential control over the federal government  \nIt argues that the president should have much more direct authority over federal agencies.  \nOne key idea is reclassifying many government employees so they can be replaced more easily. Supporters say this would make government more accountable to voters. Critics say it could politicize the civil service and remove experienced nonpartisan staff.\n\n### 2. Rolling back federal regulations  \nIt proposes cutting back environmental rules, labor regulations, and other federal oversight.  \nSupporters see this as reducing bureaucracy and boosting economic growth.  \nCritics argue it could weaken environmental protections and worker safeguards.\n\n### 3. Social policy changes  \nIt outlines conservative positions on issues like:\n- Abortion (generally supporting strong restrictions)\n- LGBTQ+ policy (especially limiting certain federal protections)\n- Education (reducing federal role, increasing local control)\n- Immigration (stronger enforcement and border measures)\n\nSupporters frame this as restoring traditional values and strengthening national sovereignty.  \nCritics argue it would reduce rights and protections for certain groups.\n\n### 4. Restructuring federal agencies  \nSome agencies would be downsized, reorganized, or have their powers reduced (for example, the Department of Education).  \nThe idea is to shrink what supporters see as an overly large federal government.\n\n---\n\n## Why it’s controversial\n\nPeople aren’t just debating the policies themselves — they’re also debating the *scale* of change.\n\n- **Supporters** say it’s a clear, organized plan to make government more efficient, accountable, and aligned with conservative voters.\n- **Critics** say it concentrates too much power in the executive branch and could weaken democratic norms or institutional checks and balances.\n\nThe biggest disagreement is about whether it’s:\n- A legitimate political agenda within normal democratic politics  \n**or**\n- A radical restructuring that could shift how the U.S. government fundamentally operates.\n\n---\n\n## Is it definitely happening?\n\nNo. It would only matter if a president who supports it wins and chooses to implement it. Even then, courts, Congress, and public opinion would still limit what can actually be done. A president can’t just unilaterally rewrite the entire system.\n\n---\n\n## Why you hear so much yelling\n\nIt touches on:\n- Executive power  \n- Civil rights  \n- Federal vs. state authority  \n- The size of government  \n\nThose are foundational questions about how the country should function — so people react strongly.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also break down:\n- What parts are realistically achievable vs. politically difficult  \n- How it compares to previous transitions (like Reagan or Trump’s first term)  \n- Or what “Schedule F” is, since that’s a big piece of it  \n\nJust tell me what angle you’re most curious about."
